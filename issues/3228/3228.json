    "Description": "A feature that I would find very useful is if you could view the results of a web method in a grid.  I develop a lot of web method that return arrays containing 10-1000 of items and viewing them as XML or as a tree is not very helpful.  Attached is a screenshot of a small test program that maby shows what I mean.",
