But it is giving me this error code. I think it is for win32 icon. In my project properties it has the value &quot;&nbsp;--standalone --win32res icon.res &quot; in other flag property. By right shouldn't be any problem.</p>\r\n<p>Can anyone please point me out?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
