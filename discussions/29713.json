    "Html": "<p>Hi Krams,</p>\r\n<p>In your F# project properties, under the &quot;Dll references&quot; part you should have this,</p>\r\n<p><em>-r &quot;Storm.UI.dll&quot; -r &quot;Ascend.dll&quot; -r &quot;Ascend.Resources.dll&quot; -r &quot;Ascend.Windows.Forms.dll&quot;  -r &quot;System.Configuration.dll&quot; -r &quot;System.Security.dll&quot; --win32res &quot;icon.res&quot;  --standalone</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><em>&quot;</em><em>-r&quot; : </em> flag for referencing other Dlls.  If the full path is not provided (like in my case above), the DLLs should be in the same folder as the project you are building.  For example, the Ascend dlls and Storm.UI.dll must be in the same directory where the storm.exe is located</li>\r\n    <li>&quot;--win32res&quot; : flag for adding a win32 icon.  Agaim the icon.res file must be in the same directory where the storm.exe is located</li>\r\n    <li>&quot;--standalone&quot; : flag for including the necessary F# libraries into the output assembly so that the app will still work even on machines where F# is not installed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A little Disclaimer : I am also new to F#.  I picked up the language a few months ago and before this I've had no prior experience with Functional programming at all! The code you will see is likely not the &quot;best practice&quot; as far as FP goes... :(  I hope to improve on this as this little project goes on.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"border:dotted .1em #aaa;border-left:none;border-right:none;font-style:italic;margin:1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding:.2em\"><br>\r\nKrams wrote:<br>\r\nHi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for putting this tool up.
